Beginning of 2025, I remember reading a post ((Find this!)) by an engineer who advocated a planning stage (with o1 or o3), then passing the plan to your ai assistant (cursor, vscode, aider) to get it done.

Six months later, it was in every ai coding tool.

Frickin' everyone has "plan mode".

Going into 2026, I think we can do better.

## Asterisk

I love planning. I'm not over planning.

Planning is great.

What I don't like is the "Mode".

These AIs are so good. And you're telling me I still need to tell them when to plan and when to exectue?

It's weird.

## Context

Ideally: Agent should self-manage.

## Doing Better

Planning phase should be obvious.

Agent should have a more persistent todo list (not just whatever is in current session)

Todos should be able to span across sessions

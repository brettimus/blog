Typography adjustments needed for better readability:

## Issues
- Post body font size feels too small
- Paragraph spacing is too large, creating awkward gaps between paragraphs

## Goals
- Increase body text font size for better readability
- Reduce paragraph spacing for tighter, more cohesive content flow
- Maintain the warm, readable aesthetic of the blog

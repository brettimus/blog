High-level design task to establish visual identity for the blog.

Considerations:
- Color scheme that fits a developer/AI-focused blog
- Typography choices for body and headings
- Dark mode support (optional, future consideration)

Files to update:
- src/styles/global.css
- Possibly add custom fonts via CSS or @fontsource packages

This is a design exploration task - may want to create a few options to choose from.

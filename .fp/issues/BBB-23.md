Create the first real blog post with a draft.

Title: 'Plan Mode Considered Harmful?'

Thesis: Having a human user manually shift between plan mode and code mode is a band-aid over the larger problem of context management. Trusting and tracking the agent's TODO list as it implements the plan is good for smaller work, but we can and should do better.

Key points to explore:
- The friction of mode-switching breaks flow
- Context management is the real challenge
- TODO tracking works but has limits
- What 'doing better' might look like

Files:
- apps/blog/src/content/blog/plan-mode-considered-harmful.md (new)

Done:
- Post exists with draft content
- Frontmatter is complete (title, description, pubDate)
- Can iterate on content later
